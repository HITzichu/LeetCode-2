## 763. Partition Labels

A string `S` of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

#### 代码

```python
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        """
        :type S: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        lastIndex = [0] * 128
        n = len(S)
        for i in range(n):
            lastIndex[ord(S[i])] = i
        
        start, end, res = 0, 0, []
        for i in range(n):
            end = max(end, lastIndex[ord(S[i])])
            if i == end:
                res.append(end - start + 1)
                start = end + 1
        
        return res
```
