## 261. Graph Valid Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1` and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
Output: false
```

**Note**: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0,1]` is the same as `[1,0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
		if len(edges) != n - 1: return False
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)
        parent = {0: -1}
        stack = [0]
        
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()
            for nb in adj[cur]:
                if nb == parent[cur]:
                    continue
                if nb in parent:
                    return False
                parent[nb] = cur
                stack.append(nb)
       
    	return len(parent) == n
```
