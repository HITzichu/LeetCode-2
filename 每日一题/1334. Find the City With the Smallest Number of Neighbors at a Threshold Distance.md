## 1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `fromi` and `toi`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is **at most** `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities ***i*** and ***j*** is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_02.png)**

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi < toi < n`
- `1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4`
- All pairs `(fromi, toi)` are distinct.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def findTheCity(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], distanceThreshold: int) -> int:
                  
          # Floyd-warshall
          
          dp = [[float('inf') for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
          for ed in edges:
              u, v, weight = ed[0], ed[1], ed[2]
              dp[u][v] = dp[v][u] = weight
          
          for k in range(n):
              for u in range(n):
                  for v in range(n):
                      dp[u][v] = min(dp[u][v], dp[u][k] + dp[k][v])
          
          ans = -1
          min_neighbor = float('inf')
          for u in range(n):
              cur_neighbor = 0
              for v in range(n):
                  if v != u and dp[u][v] <= distanceThreshold:
                      cur_neighbor += 1
              if cur_neighbor <= min_neighbor:
                  min_neighbor = cur_neighbor
                  ans = u
          
          return ans
  ```
