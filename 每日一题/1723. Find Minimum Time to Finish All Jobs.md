## 1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-finish-all-jobs/

You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the `ith` job.

There are `k` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is **minimized**.

*Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: jobs = [1,2,4,7,8], k = 2
Output: 11
Explanation: Assign the jobs the following way:
Worker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)
Worker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)
The maximum working time is 11.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`
- `1 <= jobs[i] <= 107`

        jobs = _jobs, s.resize(k);

    void dfs(int a, int b, int c) {
        if (c > ans) return;
        if (a == jobs.size()) {
            ans = c;
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
            s[i] += jobs[a];
            dfs(a + 1, b, max(c, s[i]));
            s[i] -= jobs[a];
        }
        
        if (b < s.size()) {
            s[b] += jobs[a];
            dfs(a + 1, b + 1, max(c, s[b]));
            s[b] = 0;
        }
    }
