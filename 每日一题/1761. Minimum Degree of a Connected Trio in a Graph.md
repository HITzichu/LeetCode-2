## 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-degree-of-a-connected-trio-in-a-graph/

You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `ui` and `vi`.

A **connected trio** is a set of **three** nodes where there is an edge between **every** pair of them.

The **degree of a connected trio** is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return *the **minimum** degree of a connected trio in the graph, or* `-1` *if the graph has no connected trios.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There is exactly one trio, which is [1,2,3]. The edges that form its degree are bolded in the figure above.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/26/trios2.png)

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,3],[4,1],[4,3],[2,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,5],[2,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are exactly three trios:
1) [1,4,3] with degree 0.
2) [2,5,6] with degree 2.
3) [5,6,7] with degree 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 400`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1) / 2`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- There are no repeated edges.

### 代码

```cpp
bool st[1000000];

class Solution {
public:
    int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        memset(st, 0, sizeof st);
        vector<int> d(n + 1);
        for (auto& e: edges) {
            int a = e[0], b = e[1];
            if (a > b) swap(a, b);
            d[a] ++, d[b] ++ ;
            st[a * 1000 + b] = true;
        }

        int res = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i ++ )
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j ++ )
                if (st[i * 1000 + j])
                    for (int k = j + 1; k <= n; k ++ )
                        if (st[i * 1000 + k] && st[j * 1000 + k])
                            res = min(res, d[i] + d[j] + d[k] - 6);
        if (res == INT_MAX) res = -1;
        return res;
    }
};
```
