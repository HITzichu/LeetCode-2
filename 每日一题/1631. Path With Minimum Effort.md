## 1631. Path With Minimum Effort

https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/

You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum **effort**.

A route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return *the minimum **effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex2.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex3.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
```
