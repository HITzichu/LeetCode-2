## 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule (DP-hard)

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/

You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `i-th` job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).

You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `i-th` job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return *the minimum difficulty* of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return **-1**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7
```

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobs, int d) {
        if (jobs.length < d)    return -1;
        int n = jobs.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][d+1];
        for (int[] row : dp)
            Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE/2);
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int k = 1; k < d + 1; k++) {
                int MD = 0;
                for (int j = i - 1; j >= k - 1; j--) {
                    MD = Math.max(MD, jobs[j]);
                    dp[i][k] = Math.min(dp[i][k], dp[j][k-1] + MD);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][d];
    }
}
```
