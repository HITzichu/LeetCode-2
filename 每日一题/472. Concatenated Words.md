## 472. Concatenated Words (Hard)

https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/

Given an array of strings `words` (**without duplicates**), return *all the **concatenated words** in the given list of* `words`.

A **concatenated word** is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
```

 ### 代码

- 动态规划 + HashSet

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        hs = set()
        for word in words:
            hs.add(word)
        res = []
        
        
        def check(word):
            n = len(word)
            f = [float('-inf')] * (n + 1)
            f[0] = 0
            for i in range(n + 1):
                if f[i] < 0: continue
                for j in range(n - i, 0, -1):
                    if word[i:i+j] in hs:
                        f[i + j] = max(f[i + j], f[i] + 1)
                        if f[n] > 1:
                            return True        
            return False
        
        
        for word in words:
            if (check(word)):
                res.append(word)
        return res
```
