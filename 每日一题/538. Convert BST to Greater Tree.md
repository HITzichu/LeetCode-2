## 538. Convert BST to Greater Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a *binary search tree* is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Note:** This question is the same as 1038: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```



### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    int total = 0;
    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        change(root);
        return root;
    }
    public void change(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        change(root.right);
        total += root.val;
        root.val = total;
        change(root.left);
    }
}
```
