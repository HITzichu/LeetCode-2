## 1706. Where Will the Ball Fall

https://leetcode.com/problems/where-will-the-ball-fall/

You have a 2-D `grid` of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

- A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as `1`.
- A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as `-1`.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return *an array* `answer` *of size* `n` *where* `answer[i]` *is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the* `ith` *column at the top, or `-1` \*if the ball gets stuck in the box\*.*

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/26/ball.jpg)**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: This example is shown in the photo.
Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.
Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: The ball gets stuck against the left wall.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,-1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is `1` or `-1`.



### 思路

We only need to simulate each ball's movement from the top, "n" and "m" mean rows and cols of the grid, "x" means **current row**, "y" means **current column**, "z" means **which part of the grid**, here I denote `z = 1` for above the diagonal, `z = 0` for below the diagonal. 

- If the current pos `grid[x][y]` is 1, that means the ball will **go right**, so we need to check if the ball will exceed the right edge(`y+1 == m` , "m" for the column number), and check `grid[x][y+1]`, if we find `grid[x][y+1] == -1`, which means the ball cannot move further and it will stop here.
- Else, when the current pos `grid[x][y]` is -1, that means the ball will **go left**, so we need to check if the ball will hit/exceed the left edge(`y-1 < 0`), and check `grid[x][y-1]`, if we find `grid[x][y-1] == 1`, ball will stop.



### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def findBall(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]: 
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        res = []
        for i in range(m):
            x, y, z = 0, i, 0 # z:= upper half-grid is 0, lower half-grid is 1.
            while (x < n) :
                if z == 0:
                    if grid[x][y] == 1: # will fall to right
                        if y+1==m or grid[x][y+1] == -1:
                            y = -1 # stop falling
                        else:
                            y, z = y + 1, 1;
                    else: # will fall to left
                        if y-1 < 0 or grid[x][y-1] == 1:
                            y = -1
                        else:
                            y, z = y - 1, 1
                
                else:
                    # at lower-half, goes down
                    x, z = x + 1, 0
                if y == -1:     # this ball stops, no longer to calculate
                    break
            res.append(y)
        return res
