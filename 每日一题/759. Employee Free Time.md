# 759. Employee Free Time

https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/

### 题目

We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for *all* employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined). Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
```

### 代码1

- Merge Interval

```python
class Solution(object):
    def employeeFreeTime(self, schedule):
        """
        :type schedule: List[List[Interval]]
        :rtype: List[Interval]
        """
        results = []
        schedules = []
        for times in schedule:
            schedules.extend(times)
        
        schedules.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)
        pre = schedules[0]
        
        for cur in schedules[1:]:
            if cur.start > pre.end:
                results.append(Interval(pre.end, cur.start))
                pre = cur
            else:
                pre.start = min(pre.start, cur.start)
                pre.end = max(pre.end, cur.end)
        return results
```

- MinHeap
