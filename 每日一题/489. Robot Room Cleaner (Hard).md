## 489. Robot Room Cleaner (Hard)

https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-room-cleaner/

Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.

Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.

The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 90 degrees.

When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it stays on the current cell.

Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs shown below.

```
interface Robot {
  // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
  // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.
  boolean move();

  // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
  // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
  void turnLeft();
  void turnRight();

  // Clean the current cell.
  void clean();
}
```

**Example:**

```
Input:
room = [
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
],
row = 1,
col = 3

Explanation:
All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
```

```java
class Solution {
    
    private static final int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}};
    
    public void cleanRoom(Robot robot) {
        clean(robot, 0, 0, 0, new HashSet<>());
    }
    
    private void clean(Robot robot, int x, int y, int curDirection, Set<String> visited) {
        // Cleans current cell.
        robot.clean();
        visited.add(x + " " + y);
        
        for (int nDirection = curDirection; 
             nDirection < curDirection + 4; 
             nDirection++) {
            int nx = directions[nDirection % 4][0] + x;
            int ny = directions[nDirection % 4][1] + y;
            if (!visited.contains(nx + " " + ny) && robot.move()) {
                clean(robot, nx, ny, nDirection % 4, visited);
            }
            // Changed orientation.
            robot.turnRight();
        }
        
        // Moves backward one step while maintaining the orientation.
        robot.turnRight();
        robot.turnRight();
        robot.move();
        robot.turnRight();
        robot.turnRight();
    }
}
