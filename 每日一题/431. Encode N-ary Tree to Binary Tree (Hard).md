## 431. Encode N-ary Tree to Binary Tree (Hard)

https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-n-ary-tree-to-binary-tree/

Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See following example).*

For example, you may encode the following `3-ary` tree to a binary tree in this way:

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
```

Note that the above is just an example which *might or might not* work. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.



 

**Constraints:**

- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
- The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`
- Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.

### 代码

Python

```python
class Codec:
    # Encodes an n-ary tree to a binary tree.
    def encode(self, root: 'Node') -> TreeNode:
        if not root: return None
        result = TreeNode(root.val)
        if len(root.children) > 0:
            result.left = self.encode(root.children[0])
        cur = result.left
        for i in range(1, len(root.children)):
            cur.right = self.encode(root.children[i])
            cur = cur.right
        return result

    # Decodes your binary tree to an n-ary tree.
    def decode(self, data: TreeNode) -> 'Node':
        if not data: return None
        result = Node(data.val, [])
        cur = data.left
        while cur:
            result.children += [self.decode(cur)]
            cur = cur.right
        return result
```

Java

```java
class Codec {

    // Encodes an n-ary tree to a binary tree.
    public TreeNode encode(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode result = new TreeNode(root.val);
        if (root.children.size() > 0) {
            result.left = encode(root.children.get(0));
        }
        TreeNode cur = result.left;
        for (int i = 1; i < root.children.size(); i++) {
            cur.right = encode(root.children.get(i));
            cur = cur.right;
        }
        return result;
    }

    // Decodes your binary tree to an n-ary tree.
    public Node decode(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        Node result = new Node(root.val, new LinkedList<>());
        TreeNode cur = root.left;
        while (cur != null) {
            result.children.add(decode(cur));
            cur = cur.right;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
