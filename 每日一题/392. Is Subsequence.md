## 392. Is Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/

Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Follow up:**
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

**Credits:**
Special thanks to [@pbrother](https://leetcode.com/pbrother/) for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.



### 代码

- 双指针，从头扫描一遍 t , 当 `t[i] == s[k]` , 移动 k , 最终判断k能不能走完 s. 

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        k = 0
        for c in t:
            if k < len(s) and c == s[k]:
                k += 1
        return k == len(s)
```
