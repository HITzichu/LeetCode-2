## 243. Shortest Word Distance

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/

Given a list of words and two words *word1* and *word2*, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

**Note:**
You may assume that *word1* **does not equal to** *word2*, and *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.

### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, words: List[str], word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        # O(N)
        i1,i2=-1,-1
        ans=len(words)
        for i,w in enumerate(words):
            if w==word1:
                i1=i
            elif w==word2:
                i2=i
            if i1!=-1 and i2!=-1:
                ans=min(ans,abs(i1-i2))
        return ans
```
