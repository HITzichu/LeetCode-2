## 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-submatrix-with-rearrangements/

You are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and you are allowed to rearrange the **columns** of the `matrix` in any order.

Return *the area of the largest submatrix within* `matrix` *where **every** element of the submatrix is* `1` *after reordering the columns optimally.*

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/29/screenshot-2020-12-30-at-40536-pm.png)**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/29/screenshot-2020-12-30-at-40852-pm.png)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: As there are no 1s, no submatrix of 1s can be formed and the area is 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m * n <= 105`
- `matrix[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

### 代码

- 参考“直方图最大矩形面积”，对每个下边界求max的问题。这里因为可以交换任意的两列，我们可以对递推求解后的“每列”先从高到低排序，对应的面积为`q[j] * (j + 1)`，即宽度为j+1，高度为`q[j]`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def largestSubmatrix(self, w):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n, m = len(w), len(w[0])
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (w[i][j] == 1): 
                    w[i][j] += w[i-1][j]	# 递推求解连续的1
        
        q = [0] * m
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                q[j] = w[i][j]
        
            q.sort(reverse = True)
            for j in range(m):
                res = max(res, q[j] * (j + 1))
                if (q[j] == 0):
                    break
        
        return res
```
