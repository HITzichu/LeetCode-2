## 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-weakest-rows-in-a-matrix/

Given a `m * n` matrix `mat` of *ones* (representing soldiers) and *zeros* (representing civilians), return the indexes of the `k` weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row ***i*** is weaker than row ***j***, if the number of soldiers in row ***i*** is less than the number of soldiers in row ***j***, or they have the same number of soldiers but ***i*** is less than ***j***. Soldiers are **always** stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always *ones* may appear first and then *zeros*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 2 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 2 
row 4 -> 5 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: mat = 
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]], 
k = 2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 1 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 1 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `2 <= n, m <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= m`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either 0 **or** 1.

### 代码

- 优化解法：二分+排序

```python
class Solution:
    def kWeakestRows(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # binary search
        arr = []
        n = len(mat[0])
        for idx, m in enumerate(mat):
            l, r = 0, n - 1
            while l < r:
                mid = l + r >> 1
                if m[mid] == 0:
                    r = mid
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            if m[n - 1] == 1:
                r += 1
            arr.append([idx, r])
        arr.sort(key = lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
        return [x[0] for x in arr[:k]]
```
