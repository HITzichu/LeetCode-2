## 887. Super Egg Drop

https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/

You are given `K` eggs, and you have access to a building with `N` floors from `1` to `N`. 

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.

You know that there exists a floor `F` with `0 <= F <= N` such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than `F` will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor `F` will not break.

Each *move*, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor `X` (with `1 <= X <= N`). 

Your goal is to know **with certainty** what the value of `F` is.

What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what `F` is, regardless of the initial value of `F`?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: K = 1, N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 1.
If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.
Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with certainty.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: K = 2, N = 6
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: K = 3, N = 14
Output: 4
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= K <= 100`
2. `1 <= N <= 10000`

```java
/*

    D(K, N) = 1 + min{max(D(K-1, i-1), D(K, N-i))  |  1 <= i <= N}
    Let:
        f(i) = D(K-1, i-1), means broken
        g(i) = D(K, N - i), means unbroken

*/

class Solution {
    private int[][] dp;
    
    public int superEggDrop(int K, int N) {
        // K eggs, N floors.
        this.dp = new int[K+1][N+1];
        for(int[] row: dp)
            Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        return D(K, N); // minimum numbers of floor
    }
    
    private int D(int k, int n) {
        // K eggs, N floors.
        if (k == 0) return 0;
        if (k == 1) return n;
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        if (dp[k][n] != Integer.MAX_VALUE)
            return dp[k][n];
        int l = 1, r = n + 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (D(k - 1, mid - 1) >= D(k, n - mid))
                r = mid;
            else
                l = mid + 1;
        }
        dp[k][n] = 1 + Math.max(D(k - 1, l - 1), D(k, n - l));
        return dp[k][n];
    }
