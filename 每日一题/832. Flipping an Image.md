## 832. Flipping an Image

https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/

Given a binary matrix `A`, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed. For example, flipping `[1, 1, 0]` horizontally results in `[0, 1, 1]`.

To invert an image means that each `0` is replaced by `1`, and each `1` is replaced by `0`. For example, inverting `[0, 1, 1]` results in `[1, 0, 0]`.

### 代码

```python
class Solution(object):
    def flipAndInvertImage(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        # flip
        if not A:	return []
        for i, img in enumerate(A):
            A[i] = img[::-1]

        # Invert
        for i, img in enumerate(A):
            for j, pixel in enumerate(img):
                if pixel == 0:
                    img[j] = 1
                else:
                    img[j] = 0
        return A
```
