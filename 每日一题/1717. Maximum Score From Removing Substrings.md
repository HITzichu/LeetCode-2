## 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/

You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
Output: 20

### 代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGain(string s, int x, int y) {
        if (x < y) {
            swap(x,y);
            for (auto &c : s) {
                if (c == 'a') c = 'b';
                else if (c == 'b') c = 'a';
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != 'a' && s[i] != 'b') continue;
            int j = i + 1;
            while (j < s.size() && (s[j] == 'a' || s[j] == 'b')) {
                j++;
            }
            int A = 0, B = 0, C = 0;
            for (int k = j-1, t = 0; k >= i; k--) {
                if (s[k] == 'a') {
                    A++;
                    if (t > 0) {
                        C++;
                        t--;
                    }
                } else {
                    B++;
                    t++;
                }
            }
            res += x * C + (min(A, B) - C) * y;
            i = j - 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
