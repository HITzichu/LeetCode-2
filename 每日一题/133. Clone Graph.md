## 133. Clone Graph

**Cuz the description is too long, please refer to LeetCode URL**

https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/

Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

### 代码

- BFS

  The main idea is to maintain an adjacency list in dict, ```visited[node].neighbors``` means the "node" holds all its neighbors in a **list** when we traverse the graph.

  Then, we need to avoid duplicate add, so everytime we choose to create the neighbor node if it is not visited, otherwise we just append this visited neighbor to ```visited[node].neighbors```

  ```python
  """
  # Definition for a Node.
  class Node:
      def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
          self.val = val
          self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
  """
  
  class Solution:
      def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
          if not node:
              return node
          visited = {}
          queue = deque([node])
          visited[node] = Node(node.val, [])
          
          # BFS
          while queue:
              n = queue.popleft()
              for nei in n.neighbors:
                  if nei not in visited:
                      visited[nei] = Node(nei.val, [])
                      queue.append(nei)
                  visited[n].neighbors.append(visited[nei])
          
          return visited[node]
  ```

- DFS
