## 1029. Two City Scheduling 

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/

A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti]`, the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `a` is `aCosti`, and the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `b` is `bCosti`.

Return *the minimum cost to fly every person to a city* such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
Output: 1859
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
Output: 3086 
```

**Constraints:**

- `2n == costs.length`
- `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
- `costs.length` is even.
- `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`

### 思路

- Greedy
  - Sort the persons in the ascending order by `price_A - price_B` parameter, which indicates the company additional costs.
  - To minimise the costs, send `n` persons with the smallest `price_A - price_B` to the city A, and the others to the city B.

### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        total = 0
        costs.sort(key = lambda x:x[0]-x[1])
        n = len(costs) // 2
        
        # send costs[i][0] to A, costs[i][1] to B
        A, B = 0, 1
        for i in range(len(costs) // 2):
            total += costs[i][A] + costs[i + n][B]
        return total
```
