## 1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome/

Given a string `s`. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return *the minimum number of steps* to make `s` palindrome.

A **Palindrome String** is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we don't need any insertions.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "mbadm"
Output: 2
Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 5
Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "g"
Output: 0
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "no"
Output: 1
```

### 思路

- Recurrence with memo: 

  Ins(i, j): number of chars that need to be inserted in s[i..j] to make it a palindrome.

  ***Base cases*** (substrings of length 1 and 2):

  Ins(i, i) = 0 (substring of length 1, they are all palindrome)

  Ins(i, i+1) = 0 if s[i] == s[i+1], else 1 (substrings of length 2)

  ***General cases*** (substrings of length >= 3):

  Ins(i, j) = Ins(i+1, j-1) if s[i] == s[j], else Ins(i, j) = min(1 + Ins(i+1, j), 1 + Ins(i, j+1))

  ***Goal***:

  Ins(0, n-1) (the entire s)

- 二维DP，建立数组，button-up求解`dp[0][n-1]`.

### 代码

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minInsertions(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n))]
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
                    
        return dp[0][n-1]
```
