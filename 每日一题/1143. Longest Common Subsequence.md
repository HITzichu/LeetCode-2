## 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A *subsequence* of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A *common subsequence* of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```



### 思路

- 字符串动态规划，```dp[i][j]``` 表示 text1 从 “0...i” 与 text2 从 "0...j" 的最大公共子序列个数，需要两重循环，时间复杂度n^2
  - 如果 text1[i] == text2[j]，则表示找到公共字符，公共子序列可以加1，```dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1```
  - 否则，取两种情况的最大值，即```dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])```

### 代码

- Java, 二维DP

  ```java
  class Solution {
      public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
          char[] s1 = text1.toCharArray();
          char[] s2 = text2.toCharArray();
          
          int n = s1.length, m = s2.length;
          int[][] f = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
          for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
              for (int j = 1; j <= m; j ++ ) {
                  f[i][j] = Math.max(f[i - 1][j], f[i][j - 1]);
                  if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1])
                      f[i][j] = Math.max(f[i][j], f[i - 1][j - 1] + 1);
              }
          }
          return f[n][m];
      }
  }
  ```

  

- 二维DP (top-down)

  ```python
  # 2D DP method
  class Solution:
      def longestCommonSubsequence(self, w1: str, w2: str) -> int:       
          m, n = len(w1), len(w2)
          dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]
          for i in range(1, m+1):
              for j in range(1, n+1):
                  if w1[i-1] == w2[j-1]:
                      dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                  else:
                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
          return dp[-1][-1]
  ```

- 二维DP (bottom-up)

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def longestCommonSubsequence(self, w1: str, w2: str) -> int:  
  		n1, n2 = len(s1), len(s2)
          dp = [(n2 + 1) * [0] for _ in range(n1 + 1)]
          for i in range(n1-1, -1, -1):
              for j in range(n2-1, -1, -1):
                  if s1[i] == s2[j]:
                      dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i+1][j+1]
                  else:
                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])
          return dp[0][0]
  ```

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def longestCommonSubsequence(self, w1: str, w2: str) -> int:        
          m, n = len(w1), len(w2)
          dp = [0] * (n+1)
          for i in range(m):
              cur = [0] * (n+1)
              for j in range(n):
                  if w1[i] == w2[j]:
                      cur[j+1] = dp[j] + 1
                  else:
                      cur[j+1] = max(cur[j], dp[j+1])
              dp = cur
          return dp[-1]
