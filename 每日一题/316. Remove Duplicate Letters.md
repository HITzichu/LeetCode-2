## 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/

Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

**Note:** This question is the same as 1081: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.



### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s: str) -> str:
        if not s:
            return ""
        stack = []
        seen = set()
        
        last_occur = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in seen:
                while stack and c < stack[-1] and i < last_occur[stack[-1]]:
                    seen.discard(stack.pop())
                seen.add(c)
                stack.append(c)
                
        return "".join(stack)
```
