## 1713. Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-subsequence/

You are given an array `target` that consists of **distinct** integers and another integer array `arr` that **can** have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in `arr`. For example, if `arr = [1,4,1,2]`, you can add `3` in the middle and make it `[1,4,3,1,2]`. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to make* `target` *a **subsequence** of* `arr`*.*

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,2,3,7,2,1,4]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes arr = [5,9,4,1,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of arr.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], arr = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= target.length, arr.length <= 105`
- `1 <= target[i], arr[i] <= 109`
- `target` contains no duplicates.

### 代码

- 思路为 longest increasing subsequence, 二分思想
- 找到 LIS 中小于当前值最大下标/最大值，比如[1,2,4,5]，此时如果要插入3，那么应该在2的后面将4替换为3，因为2是小于3的最大值。以此类推，保证LCS的最后一个数一定是随着序列长度增加而严格递增的。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minOperations(self, target, arr):
        """
        :type target: List[int]
        :type arr: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(target)

        pos = {}
        for i in range(n):
            pos[target[i]] = i

        stack = []

        for num in arr:
            if num not in pos:
                continue
                
            i = bisect.bisect_left(stack,pos[num])
            if i == len(stack):
                stack.append(pos[num])
            else:
                stack[i] = pos[num]

        return n - len(stack)
```
