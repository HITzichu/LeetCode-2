## 1755. Closest Subsequence Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-subsequence-sum/

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return *the **minimum** possible value of* `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
Output: 7
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 40`
- `-107 <= nums[i] <= 107`
- `-109 <= goal <= 109`

```java

    public int N = 2000010;
    public int[] q = new int[N]; 
    public int n, cnt, goal, ans;
    public int minAbsDifference(int[] nums, int _goal) {
        n = nums.length;
        goal = _goal;
        cnt = 0;
        ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        dfs1(nums, 0, 0);
        Arrays.sort(q, 0, cnt);
        dfs2(nums, (n + 1) / 2, 0);
        return ans;
    }
    public void dfs1(int[] nums, int u, int s) {
        if (u == (n + 1) / 2) {
            q[cnt ++] = s;
            return;
        }
        dfs1(nums, u + 1, s);
        dfs1(nums, u + 1, s + nums[u]);
    }
    public void dfs2(int[] nums, int u, int s) {
        if (u == n) {
            // binary search
            int l = 0, r = cnt - 1;
            while (l < r) {
                int mid = l + r + 1 >> 1;
                if (q[mid] + s <= goal)
                    l = mid;
                else
                    r = mid - 1;
            }
            ans = Math.min(ans, Math.abs(q[r] + s - goal));
            // case 2
            if (r + 1 < cnt)
                ans = Math.min(ans, Math.abs(q[r + 1] + s - goal));
            return;
        }
        dfs2(nums, u + 1, s);
        dfs2(nums, u + 1, s + nums[u]);
    }
