## 1730. Shortest Path to Get Food

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-to-get-food/

You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You want to find the shortest path to arrive at a food cell.

You are given an `m x n` character matrix, `grid`, of these different types of cells:

- `'*'` is your location. There is **exactly one** `'*'` cell.
- `'#'` is a food cell. There may be **multiple** food cells.
- `'O'` is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
- `'X'` is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.

Return *the length of the shortest path for you to reach **any** food cell*. If there is no path for you to reach food, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","O","O","X"],["X","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: It takes 3 steps to reach the food.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/img2.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","#","X"],["X","X","X","X","X"]]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is not possible to reach the food.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/img3.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","X","O","#","O","X"],["X","O","O","X","O","O","X","X"],["X","O","O","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: There can be multiple food cells. It only takes 6 steps to reach the bottom food.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: grid = [["O","*"],["#","O"]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: grid = [["X","*"],["#","X"]]
Output: -1
```



### 代码

- BFS, O(n*m)

```python
class Solution:
    def getFood(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        dirs = [-1, 0, 1, 0, -1]
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        step = 1
        que = deque([])
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == '*':	# find start position
                    que.append((i, j))
        
        while que:
            N = len(que)
            for _ in range(N):
                cur = que.popleft()
                for i in range(len(dirs) - 1):
                    x, y = cur[0] + dirs[i], cur[1] + dirs[i + 1]
                    if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m:
                        if grid[x][y] == '#':
                            return step
                        if grid[x][y] == 'X':
                            continue
                        grid[x][y] = 'X'
                        que.append((x, y))
            step += 1
        
        return -1
```
