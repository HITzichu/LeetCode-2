```
Input: tree = [2,1,3], node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both the node and the return value is of Node type.

```
Input: tree = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], node = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.

```
Input: tree = [15,6,18,3,7,17,20,2,4,null,13,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,9], node = 15
Output: 17

### 思路

- 这道题要求只给一个 node，然后在 BST 中找到这个节点的后继节点，注意题目没有给出树的结构。
- There are only 3 ways that one node may have a successor
  - it has a right child，有右孩子，直接返回右孩子
  - it has a parent，
    - it is the left child of its parent
    - it is the right child of its parent

### 代码

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
"""

class Solution(object):
    def inorderSuccessor(self, node):
        """
        :type node: Node
        :rtype: Node
        """
        
        if not node:
            return None
        
        if node.right:
            # if node has right child, return most left of right child
            node = cur = node.right
            while node:
                cur = node
                node = node.left
            return cur
        
        elif node.parent and node.parent.left == node:
            # if node is a left child of its parent, return its parent
            return node.parent
       
    	elif node.parent and node.parent.right == node:
            # if node is a right child of its parent, 
            # reaching to the parent until node is a left child of the parent
            # like Example 4, we need to find "13" -> "7" -> "6" -> "15",
            # because now "13" is a left child of "15", so we stop finding
            while node.parent and node == node.parent.right:
                node = node.parent
            return node.parent
        
        
        else:
            # no such successor!
            return None
```
