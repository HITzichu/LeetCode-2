## 824. Goat Latin (easy)

https://leetcode.com/problems/goat-latin/

A sentence `S` is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "*Goat Latin"* (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

- If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append `"ma"` to the end of the word.
  For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.

- If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add `"ma"`.
  For example, the word `"goat"` becomes `"oatgma"`.
   
- Add one letter `'a'` to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
  For example, the first word gets `"a"` added to the end, the second word gets `"aa"` added to the end and so on.

Return the final sentence representing the conversion from `S` to Goat Latin.

            if words[i][0] in s_vowel:
                words[i] += "ma" + "a" * (i+1) + " "
            else:
                words[i] = words[i][1:] + words[i][0] + "ma" + "a" * (i+1) + " "
        return "".join(words)[:-1]
