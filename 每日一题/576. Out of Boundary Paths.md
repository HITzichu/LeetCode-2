## 576. Out of Boundary Paths

https://leetcode.com/problems/out-of-boundary-paths/

There is an **m** by **n** grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate **(i,j)** of the ball, you can move the ball to **adjacent** cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can **at most** move **N** times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
Output: 6
Explanation:

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
Output: 12
Explanation:

**Note:**

1. Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
2. The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
3. N is in range [0,50].

### 代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> f;
    int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0}, dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    int findPaths(int m, int n, int N, int i, int j) {
        f = vector<vector<vector<int>>>(m, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(N + 1, -1)));
        return dfs(m, n, N, i, j);
    }
    
    int dfs(int m, int n, int k, int x, int y)
    {
        int &v = f[x][y][k];
        if (v != -1) return v;
        v = 0;
        if (!k) return v;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int a = x + dx[i], b = y + dy[i];
            if (a < 0 || b < 0 || a == m || b == n)
                v++;
            else
                v += dfs(m, n, k - 1, a, b);
            v %= mod;
        }
        return v;
    }
};
