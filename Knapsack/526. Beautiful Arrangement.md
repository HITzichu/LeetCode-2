## 526. Beautiful Arrangement

https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement/

Suppose you have `n` integers labeled `1` through `n`. A permutation of those `n` integers `perm` (**1-indexed**) is considered a **beautiful arrangement** if for every `i` (`1 <= i <= n`), **either** of the following is true:

- `perm[i]` is divisible by `i`.
- `i` is divisible by `perm[i]`.

Given an integer `n`, return *the **number** of the **beautiful arrangements** that you can construct*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
    - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
    - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
    - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
    - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 15`

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int countArrangement(int n) {
        int[] f = new int[1 << n];
        f[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < (1<<n); i++) {
            int k = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) 
                if (((i >> j) & 1) == 1)
                    k++;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                if (((i >> j) & 1) == 0)
                {
                    if ((k + 1) % (j + 1) == 0 || (j + 1) % (k + 1) == 0)
                        f[i | (1 << j)] += f[i];
                }
        }
        return f[(1 << n) - 1];
    }
}
```
